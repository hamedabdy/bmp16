#### General information about Iranian visa:

All visitors must hold a passport valid for at least 6 months during visa application.

Visitors to Iran must obtain a visa from one of the Iranian Embassy / Consulates unless they come from one of the visa exempt countries. 
Having a visa prior to your arrival in Iran is by far the safest way to avoid any kind of inconveniences.

#### How to obtain a visa?

After a visa application submission through our services, you will be delivered a visa authorization number in the shortest time. Upon your submission an authorization number request is made. During submission you will be asked to provide the following information and documents:

- Personal details and your planned itinerary (Visa application forms: <span class="visaLinks"><a href="/files/VISA%20FORM.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="/files/VISA-LIGHT.xlsx">XLSX</a></span>)
- A scanned copy of your passport identification page(s)

Unless urgent option is specified, visa authorization could take up to 5 working days. Please do note that you must also specify visa pickup location between Iranian Embassies/ Consulates or the arrival airports.

Accompanied with the visa authorization number you will receive our guidance and assistance in obtaining your visa since every Embassy/ Consulate has their own policies on providing information and documents. Otherwise you are required go to the previously chosen visa pickup location and provide the following:

- 2 photos of the applicant (dimensions differ for each country)
- A photocopy of your passport identification page(s)
- An attestation of insurance for the travel period
- A fill-in form provided by the location
- Visa application fees
- Other documents specified by the location

The Embassy/ Consulate can issue your visa from few hours up to 2 (two) weeks, depending on the location and the amount of work of the Embassy/ Consulate. In case of an emergency please do specify upon submission to benefit from the urgent option.
