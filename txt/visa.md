#### General information about Iranian visa:

All visitors must hold a passport valid for at least 6 months during visa application.

Visitors to Iran must obtain a visa from one of the Iranian diplomatic missions unless they come from one of the visa exempt countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Egypt, Georgia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Syria, Turkey). 
Getting a visa prior to your arrival in Iran is by far the safest way to avoid any kind of inconveniences.

#### How to get the visa?

After a visa application submission through our services, you will be delivered a visa authorization number from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in the shortest time. Afterwards you may choose between Iranian Embassy/ Consulate/ arrival airport that you chose previously to pickup your visa. Upon your submission an authorization number request is made. During submission you will be asked to provide the following information and documents:

- Personal details and your planned itinerary
- A scanned copy of your passport filled pages

Unless urgent option is specified, visa authorization could take up to 5 days. Please do note that you must also specify visa pickup location between Iranian Embassies/ Consulates or the arrival airports.

Accompanied with the visa authorization number you will receive our guidance and assistance in obtaining your visa since every Embassy/ Consulate has their own policies on providing information and documents. Otherwise you must go to the previously chosen visa pickup location and provide the following:

- 2 photos of the applicant (dimensions differ for each country)
- A photocopy of your passport identity page
- An attestation of insurance for the travel time
- A fill-in form provided by the location
- Visa application fees
- Other documents specified by the location

The Embassy/ Consulate can issue your visa from few hours up to 2 (two) weeks, depending on the location and the amount of work of the Embassy/ Consulate. In case of an emergency please do specify upon submission to benefit from the urgent option.

Your visa authorization number is valid for 3 months from date of issue. You may ask for from 1 (one) week up to 1 (one) month (4 (four) weeks) visa duration. Visa dates are prolongable.
